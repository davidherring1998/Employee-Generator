# Employee-Generator

## About
The Employee-Generator is a command-line application that allows users to create a webpage displaying their team's basic information. This tool is designed for quick access to team members' email and GitHub profiles.

## How It Works
- **Creating a Manager**: The application starts by prompting the user to input the manager's information, thus creating a manager profile.
- **Adding Team Engineers**: Users can then add engineers to their team. For each engineer, the application prompts for their GitHub username, which turns into a clickable link in the generated webpage.
- **Adding Team Interns**: Similarly, users can add interns to the team, with each member's details being captured.
- **Accessible Contact Information**: All email addresses inputted are clickable. Clicking an email opens the user's default email program, populating the 'TO' field with the employee's email.

## Features
- Command-line interface for easy and interactive input.
- Generates a webpage with team members' details.
- Clickable email links for quick email drafting.
- Clickable GitHub profile links for engineers.
- Easy addition of multiple roles: managers, engineers, and interns.

## Usage
- Run the application using your command-line interface.
- Follow the prompts to input team members' details.
- The generated webpage will be available for viewing and interaction upon completion.
