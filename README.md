# Employee-Generator
About: A user can generate a webpage that displays their team's basic info so they can quickly access their email and github profiles. When the user prompts the command-line application, the user is given the option to create a manager by inputting the manager's information. Then the user is given the option to create a team engineer and is prompted to input the engineer's github that turns into a clickable link. Next the user is prompted to create a team intern. All of the email's are clickable and the user's default email program opens and populates the TO field with the employee's email.
